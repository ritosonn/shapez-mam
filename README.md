# Shapez MAM Analyzer

It is not easy to create a complete automatic generator (MAM) in Shapez. The main reasons are as follows:

- There is a dependency on the Stacker steps. There is a step to float the object using a Cutter, such as the logo shape and rocket shape. There is also a step to extrude it to an invisible fifth layer using a Stacker.
- The circuit design is restricted to a flat surface. Compared to Factorio, the flexibility of wiring is smaller and the constants and variables are limited, so the circuit to achieve the same function becomes bloated.

In this project, we calculate a list of shapes that can be generated by Shapez and how to compose them. We also consider how to simplify the object composition to be created by calculating the common parts of the composition methods.
